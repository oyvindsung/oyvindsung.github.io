They are useful for building several different kinds of software, including the lexical analysis component of a compiler and systems for verifying the correctness of circuits or protocols, for example.Regular Expressions: These are a structural notation for describing the same patterns that can be represented by finite automata. They are used in many common types of software, including tools to search for patterns in text or in file names, for instance.Context-Free Grammars: These are an important notation for describing the structure of programming languages and related sets of strings; they are used to build the parser component of a compiler.Turing Machines: These are automata that model the power of real computers. They allow us to study decidability, the question of what can or cannot be done by a computer. They also let us distinguish tractable problems - those that can be solved in polynomial time - from the intractable problems - those that cannot.Deductive Proofs: This basic method of proof proceeds by listing statements that are either given to be true, or that follow logically from some of the previous statements.Proving If-Then Statements: Many theorems are of the form &quot;if (something) then (something else).&quot; The statement or statements following the &quot;if&quot; are the hypothesis, and what follows &quot;then&quot; is the conclusion. Deductive proofs of if-then statements begin with the hypothesis, and continue with statements that follow logically from the hypothesis and previous statements, until the conclusion is proved as one of the statements.Proving If-And-Only-If Statements: There are other theorems of the form &quot;(something) if and only if (something else)&quot;. They are proved by showing if-then statements in both directions. A similar kind of theorem claims the equality of the sets described in two different ways; these are proved by showing that each of the two sets is contained in the other.Proving the Contrapositive: Sometimes, it is easier to prove a statement of the form &quot;if HHH then CCC&quot; by proving the equivalent statement: &quot;if not CCC then not HHH&quot;. The latter is called the contrapositive of the former.Proof by Contradiction: Other times, it is more convenient to prove the statement &quot;if HHH then CCC&quot; by proving &quot;if HHH and not CCC then (something known to be false)&quot;. A proof of this type is called proof by contradiction.Counterexamples: Sometimes we are asked to show that a certain statement is not true. If the statement has one or more parameters, then we can show it is false as a generality by providing just one counterexample, that is, one assignment of values to the parameters that makes the statement false.Inductive Proofs: A statement that has an integer parameter nnn can often be proved by induction on nnn. We prove the statement is true for the basis, a finite number of cases for particular values of nnn, and then prove the inductive step: that if the statement is true for values up to nnn, then it is true for n+1n+1n+1.Structural Inductions: In some situations, including many in this book, the theorem to be proved inductively is about some recursively defined construct, such as trees. We may prove a theorem about the constructed objects by induction on the number of steps used in its construction. This type of induction is referred to as structural.Alphabets: An alphabet is any finite set of symbols.Strings: A string is a finite-length sequence of symbols.Languages and Problems: A language is a (possibly infinite) set of strings, all of which choose their symbols from some one alphabet. When the strings of a language are to be interpreted in some way, the question of whether a string is in the language is sometimes called a problem.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"This is H1","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/Computability and Logic/MDX file test","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"This is H2​","type":1,"pageTitle":"This is H1","url":"/docs/Computability and Logic/MDX file test#this-is-h2","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"This is H3​","type":1,"pageTitle":"This is H1","url":"/docs/Computability and Logic/MDX file test#this-is-h3","content":" This is H4​  This is H5​  This is H6​  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Autolink literals​","type":1,"pageTitle":"This is H1","url":"/docs/Computability and Logic/MDX file test#autolink-literals","content":" www.example.com, https://example.com, and contact@example.com.

There are two preferred notations for describing automata:  A transition diagram, which is a graph such as the ones we saw before.A transition table, which is a tabular listing of δ\\deltaδ function, which by implication tells us the set of states and the input alphabet.  Transition Diagrams​  A transition diagram for a DFA A=(Q,Σ,δ,q0,F)A=(Q,\\Sigma,\\delta,q_0,F)A=(Q,Σ,δ,q0​,F) is a graph defined as follows:  For each state in QQQ there is a node.For each state qqq in QQQ and each input symbol aaa in Σ\\SigmaΣ, let δ(q,a)=p\\delta(q,a)=pδ(q,a)=p.Then the transition diagram has an arc from node qqq to node ppp, labeled aaa. If there are several input symbols that cause transitions from aaa to ppp, then the transition diagram can have one arc, labeled by the list of these symbols.There is an arrow into the start state q0q_0q0​, labeled Start. This arrow does not originate at any node.Nodes corresponding to accepting states (those in FFF) are marked by a double circle. States noe in FFF have a single circle.  Figure 1 shows the transition diagram for the DFA that we designed before.  Figure 1. The transition diagram for the DFA accepting all strings with a substring &quot;01&quot;.  Transition Tables​  A transition table is a conventional, tabular representation of a function like δ\\deltaδ that takes two arguments and returns a value. The rows of the table correspond to the states, and the columns correspond to the inputs.

Perhaps the simplest nontrivial finite automaton is an on/off switch (Figure 1).  Figure 1. A simple finite automaton.  Figure 2 shows another finite automaton that could be part of a lexical analyzer. The job of this automaton is to recognize the keyword then. It thus needs five states, each of which represents a different position in the word then that has been reached so far. These positions correspond to the prefixes of the word, ranging from the empty string (i.e., nothing of the word has been seen so far) to the complete word.

Grammars are useful models when designing software that processes data with a recursive structure. The best-known example is a &quot;parser&quot;, the component of a compiler that deals with the recursively nested features of the typical programming language, such as expressions-arithmetic, conditional, and so on. For instance,a grammatical rule like E⇒E+EE\\Rightarrow E+EE⇒E+E states that an expression can be formed by taking any two expressions and connecting them by a plus sign; this rule is typical of how expressions of real programming languages are formed. Later, we'll introduce context-free grammars, as they are usually called.Regular Expressions also denote the structure of data, especially text strings. The patterns of strings they describe are exactly the same as what can be described by finite automata. The style of these expressions differs significantly from that of grammars, and we shall content ourselves with a simple example here. The UNIX-style regular expression [A-Z][a-z]*[ ][A-Z][A-Z], represents capitalized words followed by a space and two capital letters. This expression represents patterns in text that could be a city and state, e.g., Ithaca NY. It misses multiword city names, such as Palo Alto CA, which could be captured by the more complex expression [A-Z][a-z]*([ ][A-Z] [a-z]*)*[ ][A-Z][A-Z].

The Empty String​  The empty string is the string with zero occurrences of symbols. This string, denoted ϵ\\epsilonϵ, is a string that may be chosen from any alphabet whatsoever.  Length of a String​  It is often useful to classify strings by their length, that is, the number of positions for symbols in the string. For instance, 01101 has length 5.  The standard notation for the length of a string www is ∣w∣|w|∣w∣. For example, ∣1011∣=4|1011|=4∣1011∣=4.  Power of an Alphabet​  If Σ\\SigmaΣ is an alphabet, we can express the set of all strings of a certain length from that alphabet by using an exponential notation.
